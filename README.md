Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintanance of high quality software systems.
efficiency- it helps improve the developers workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
security- implementing security measures such as two factor authentication helps to protect users' information from being breached.
reliability- it makes sure software perfoms exactly as expected.
scalability and flexibility- it ensures that software is able to handle many commands without affecting its perfomance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages- 1940s
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline -1960s
Advent of structured programming- 1970s
Rise of agile methodologies- 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- gathering and documenting the user needs and system requirements.
Design- formulating high level and detailed designs for the software architecture and user interface.
implementation- writing code and building software according to the design created earlier.
testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- releasing the software to its users
maintenance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement of the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is linear and sequential thus each phase is completed before moving on while agile methodology is iterative and incremental; has multiple cycles called sprints.
waterfall methodology has low flexibility while agile methodology has high flexibility.
in waterfall methodology customer feedback comes late after the software has been developed while in agile methodology there is regular cusomer feedback after every sprint.
in waterfall methodology testing is done at the end of development while in agile methodology testing is done continuously after every iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer:- developing programs, applications and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
                     maintaining and updating software to keep it fully functional.
                     collaborating with other team developers to ensure best practices while developing the software.
                     reporting to the project manager about the development of the project.

Quality Assuarance Engineer:- collaborating with stakeholders to understand the requirements needed for the new software.
                              creating development standard and procedures for the programmers to follow.
                              comfirming that the software meets the desired requirements before deployment.
                              analysing the product to identify bugs and suggesting changes to make them more efficient.
                              developing and executing automation scripts using open source tools.

project manager:- assembles and leads the software developing team.
                  is the bridge to discuss the project between the client and the software development team.
                  creates the projects blueprint.
                  tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
                  delivering the complete product to the client and making regular checkups for the perfomance of the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments such as Visual Studio Code and Eclipse are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writting, testing and debugging code.
IDEs can format written text making it either bold , italisized or with a different font color which makes the written text easily understandable and instantly notices accidental syntax errors made on the code.
IDEs can complete unfinished code statements for the user once they start typing the statement.
Debugging IDEs run the code line by line while inspecting code behaviour and it also has debugging tools to get rid of the bugs in the code.

Version System Controls such as git and subversions are software tools for tracking change to source code and coordinating work among team members.
importance: 
            Collaboration - enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase  without conflicts.
            Change Tracking - records a detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each moodification.
            Branching and Merging- supports making branches for new features and later merging them to the main code.
            Error recovery- allows reverting back to previous developments if the new changes introduce errors.
            
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges:
           changing requirements from the clients. 
           tight deadlines to complete the development project.
           technical debt from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions.

overcoming strategies:
                      Effective communication between the client and the development team.
                      use of Agile methodologies.
                      Prioritisation of debts.
                      regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- testing of individual components or modules of software . its ensures that individual components work as intended to even when isolated from other components.
Intergration testing- testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Helps to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing- testing the entire software system as a whole. Helps to verify that the system meets functional and non functional requirements.
Acceptance testing- testing the software againist user reqirements to ensure it meets user needs. Helps to know whether the software meets the end-user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to provide the desired outputs.
prompt engineering improves the user's experience.
prompt engineering increases the flexibility and diversity of prompts that the user can feed into the generative AI.
Prompt engineering gives the developer control over their prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
draw a car.
Draw a picture of a new matte-black carbon plated luxury Cardillac escalade cruising on a road near the eiffel tower on a sunny day on low traffic. 

clarity- the imperoved prompt specifies what is being asked.
specific details- describing the cars appearance and the cars background appearance 
concise- The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
